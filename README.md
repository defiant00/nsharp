# nsharp ![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/defiant00/nsharp/Build)

 N# is a collection of languages, all supporting the same underlying constructs and compiling to .NET. [Neutral programming](Docs/neutral_programming.md) means you can use whichever language you prefer, regardless of the language the project is actually saved in.

## Languages

* [Min](Docs/syntax_min.md) - indentation-based, minimal typing and symbols
* CStyle - C style, curlies and semicolons included. Coming soon.
